Here are Python coding examples for linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics, along with their applications in real-world projects.
##1. Linear Algebra

Code Example

```
import numpy as np

# Matrix Multiplication
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
result = np.dot(A, B)
print("Matrix Multiplication Result:\n", result)

# Solving a Linear System (Ax = b)
C = np.array([[2, -1], [-3, 4]])
d = np.array([3, 7])
solution = np.linalg.solve(C, d)
print("Solution to Linear System:", solution)
```
