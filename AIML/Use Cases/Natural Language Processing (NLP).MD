Lets use the e-commerce industry as an example.

1. Text Preprocessing

Text preprocessing involves cleaning and preparing text data for analysis. In e-commerce, it can be used to process customer reviews, product descriptions, or chat data for analysis.

Python Code Example:

```
import re
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

# Sample text
text = "The product is absolutely amazing! But the delivery was delayed by 2 days."

# Lowercasing
text = text.lower()

# Removing punctuation
text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', text)

# Tokenization
tokens = word_tokenize(text)

# Removing stopwords
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
cleaned_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word not in stop_words]

print("Cleaned Tokens:", cleaned_tokens)
```

Real-Time Usage:

Cleaning customer reviews for sentiment analysis

Preparing product descriptions for search engine optimization (SEO).

2. Sentiment Analysis


Sentiment analysis helps determine whether a piece of text is positive, negative, or neutral. In e-commerce, sentiment analysis can be used to analyze customer feedback and improve services.

Python Code Example:

```
from textblob import TextBlob

# Sample text
review = "The product quality is great, but delivery was slow."

# Sentiment analysis
blob = TextBlob(review)
sentiment = blob.sentiment.polarity

if sentiment > 0:
    print("Positive Sentiment")
elif sentiment < 0:
    print("Negative Sentiment")
else:
    print("Neutral Sentiment")

```

Real-Time Usage:

Analyzing reviews to identify customer satisfaction trends

Monitoring social media posts for brand reputation.

3. Language Models

Language models generate, predict, or classify text. In e-commerce, they can power chatbots, personalized recommendations, or auto-generated product descriptions.

Python Code Example:

Using Hugging Face's Transformers library:

```
from transformers import pipeline

# Load pre-trained language model
text_generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")

# Generate text
prompt = "This product is designed for"
generated_text = text_generator(prompt, max_length=30, num_return_sequences=1)

print("Generated Text:", generated_text[0]['generated_text'])

```
Real-Time Usage:

Building chatbots to assist customers with queries.

Generating personalized product recommendations.

Bringing It Together in E-commerce:

For instance, an e-commerce platform could:

Clean and preprocess reviews to remove noise.

Analyze sentiment to identify unhappy customers and take action.

Use language models in chatbots for answering queries or recommending products.
